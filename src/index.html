          Hi, my name is Akif Volkan. I like to solve interaction and user
          experience problems and develop new interfaces/web applications with
          javascript programming. I have 20 years of javascript programming
          background, from object oriented and vanilla javascript to famous
          frameworks such as react.js, express, mongo.db and backend
          programming with node.js and mySQL. Feel free to view some,
          <a href="http://github.com/volkanblanco" target="_blank">github</a>
          source codes i developed recently. Also i have an NPM package named
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-flags-dropdown" target="_blank">country-flags-dropdown</a> for React. Feel free to use it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working with start-ups and digital agencies for 20 years as 
          front-end developer, ui/ux developer.
          
          Depending on the projects i create wireframes and prototypes of the
          product and iterate this process in order to reach the functional
          and simple user interface with considering feedbacks, product
          strategy and personas all the time in the mind. Thus user experience
          is the main focus of my engineering processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I ride my bike, work on THREE.js projects and 3D
          stuff. Feel free to contact me from <a href="https://x.com/akifblanco" target="_blank">X</a>.
